4. Description: `CRNN+CTC OCR to read warehouse SKUs. Includes synthetic data gen, FastAPI, Gradio demo.`
5. Set to Public
6. Don't initialize with README (we have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push to GitHub
```bash
cd /Users/glesha/Desktop/Warehouse-label-digit-reader

# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/warehouse-label-digit-reader.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Add Repository Topics
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the gear icon next to "About"
3. Add these topics:
   - `ocr`
   - `crnn`
   - `ctc`
   - `pytorch`
   - `fastapi`
   - `computer-vision`
